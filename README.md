# Persian_Models_Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning  Parsbert for entailment, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, and Fine-tuning  bert2bert for summarization
 
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on various tasks including:  

- **Entailment**  
- **Sentiment Analysis**  
- **Summarization**  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  

## Notebooks  

- `entailment_fine_tuning.ipynb`: Fine-tuning "persiannlp/parsbert-base-parsinlu-entailment" for entailment tasks.  
- `sentiment_analysis_fine_tuning.ipynb`: Fine-tuning "nimaafshar/parsbert-fa-sentiment-twitter" for sentiment analysis.  
- `summarization_fine_tuning.ipynb`: Fine-tuning  "m3hrdadfi/bert2bert-fa-wiki-summary" for summarization tasks.  
- `ner_fine_tuning.ipynb`: Fine-tuning "HooshvareLab/bert-base-parsbert-armanner-uncased" for named entity recognition.  

## Requirements  

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:  

- `Transformers`  
- `datasets`  
- `torch`  
- `tensorflow` (if applicable)  
- Any other dependencies used in your notebooks.  

## Usage  

To run the notebooks, you can use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.   

1. Open the notebook in Colab by selecting `Open in Colab` from the File menu.  
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook to set up the environment and run the fine-tuning process.
